Description: Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) is an approach designed
    to help metabolomics guys identify and interpret changes in metabolite 
    level in a biologically meaningful way (e.g. pathway-based interpretation).
    This is conceptually very similar to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
    The MSEAp package provides a basic function to perform MSEA based on 
    Fisher's exact test and a simple plot function. Users can do metabolite
    enrichment analysis on their own data with KEGG and HMDB identifiers.
    Constructing their own metabolite-set is also supported from KEGG and 
    SMPDB.
